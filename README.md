Hi, I'm Ultraanoob 🚀
On a Journey to Master Programming
I'm learning Python with a clear vision: Build → Learn → Specialize → Architect

This is my learning journal. Here you'll find code, projects, and progress.

🎯 Current Focus
Learning Path:

✅ Python Fundamentals (Variables, Control Flow, Loops, Functions)

🔄 Data Structures & Algorithms

🔄 Web Development (Django/FastAPI)

🔄 System Design & Architecture

Goal: Become a Software Architect who ships scalable, elegant systems.

🛠 Tech Stack (Current & Learning)
